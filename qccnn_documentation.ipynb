    "Class to solve an Supervised Machine Learning image mult-class classification problem using a Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network. It defines a quantum convolutional layer and then a classical convolutional neural network. First, using random quantum variational angles, it processes the images and trains the classical network to find the optimal classical weights, and then, with these fixed weights, it trains the quantum layer. This algorithm is inspired by the paper *Quanvolutional Neural Networks: Powering image Recognition with Quantum Circuits* by Henderson et al. However, in the paper the angles of the quantum convolutional layer are fixed, while here we optimize them too. \n",
