    "Class to solve a Supervised Machine Learning binary classification problem using the Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) algorithm. It defines the qkernel method which is used as input of the SVC class (parent class) of scikit-learn that implements a classical SVM algorithm. Thus, all the quantumness is embedded in the definition of the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- **n_qubits** (int): Number of qubits used for the quantum circuit, which must be equal to the number of features of the dataset\n",
    "- **device** (str): Indicates whether the quantum circuits are executed locally (myQLM) or sent to a Qaptiva emulator as batches.\n",
    "- **kernel_circuit_label** (str): Encoding type for the kernel circuit. Can be either 'angle_encoding', 'zz_encoding' or None if a custom_kernel is used.\n",
    "- **angle_encoding_type** (str): Axis of rotation employed for the rotation gates of the quantum circuit ('x', 'y' or 'z'), if 'angle_encoding' is utilized. It can be None is 'zz_encoding' is selected.\n",
    "- **custom_kernel** (function): Given two input vectors, the function must create a kernel circuit and return an obbject of the class Program.\n",
