# Quantum Machine Learning (QML)

This repository contains the implementation of two QML methods: Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) and Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). Additionally, it includes an implementation of Bayesian Optimization (BO) applied to hyperparameter tuning for the quantum-inspired Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) algorithm, designed to solve Binary Combinatorial Optimization problems.
