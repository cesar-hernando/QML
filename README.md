# Quantum Machine Learning (QML) in myQLM (Eviden, Atos Group)

This repository is the result of a summer internship in Eviden and contains the implementation of three QML methods: Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) and Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCCNN). Additionally, it includes an implementation of Bayesian Optimization (BO) applied to hyperparameter tuning for the quantum-inspired Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) algorithm, designed to solve Binary Combinatorial Optimization problems.
