    "**class quantum_machine_learning.myQML.QCBM(n_qubits, basis, n_blocks, n_shots, device, sigma_list_kernel, ansatz_mode=0, execution_mode=0, dimension=None)**    \n",
    "\n",
    "QCBM is a generative model that encodes the probability distribution of classical data as a variational quantum circuit, and it is based on Born's postulate of Quantum Mechanics, which states that the probabiliy of obtaining the bitstring x as a result of measuring the quantum state $|\\psi_\\theta \\rangle$ is $|\\langle x | \\psi_\\theta \\rangle|^2$. In contrast to other methods such as Restricted Boltzmann machines, QCBM samples efficiently, as it just requires executing the quantum circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the training process, the variatioanl circuit is initialized with random parameters, and for each iteration it produces a specified number of samples and a loss function is evaluated, which measures the distance between the target distribution and the model distribution. The QCBM method employs the squared mean discrepancy loss with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. Similarly to supervised QNNs, the gradient f the loss function with respect to the variational parameters can be evaluated exactly via the Parameter Shift Rule. Thus, we can use gradient-based optimizers such as Adam or L-BFGS-B.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the optimal parameters are found and training is finished, we will generate samples from the circuit and analyse their validity. Apart from the precision metric, which measure the rate of generating valid patterns, there are other metrics that measure generalzation, which refers to not only considering the validity criterium but also whether the generated sample was seen in training. However, since our dataset is very small, it does not make sense to study its generalizability.\n",
